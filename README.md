# How it works
  The app will randomly select 10 questions from its database to ask the user. A single question might contain multiple questions attached to it, or responses to the user's answer. Each answer to every question will have one or more personality tags associated to it. At the end depending on the the user's combination of their highest and lowest personality tag occurances, they will be considered Bat Sh!t Crazy or perfectly (and boringly) sane.  
    
  The questions will vary from simple questions, to serious question about life & philosophy. There will be many trick questions as well and responses to user's answers that will give them another chance to reconsider their choice. The questions are meant to be humorous and witty, causing the user to lightly exhale in amusement at some questions and take a second to consider others.
  
  Here's an example question with choices, follow up questions, and responses to the user. Responses are typically rhetorical questions to make the user feel uneasy about their decisions. This uneasy feeling that they could have possibly chosen a better answer will likely lead them to attempt the test again choosing a different answer next time (if they happen to get the question again).
  
  __question (Q), follow up questions (FQ#), choices (CH#), and responses (RE):__  
  >__Q:__ I flip a coin 99 times and all 99 times it lands heads up. What do you think it will land on the 100th flip?  
  >__CH1:__ [HEADS] [TAILS]
  >>if __CH1__ == [HEADS]  
  >> __FQ1:__ What if I reassured you the coin was fair?  
  >>__CH2:__ [HEADS] [TAILS]
  >>>if __CH2__ == [HEADS]  
  >>> __RE:__ Do you really think it is wise to trust what you observe over the laws of probability?  
  >>>if __CH2__ == [TAILS]  
  >>> __RE:__ Are you normally this distrusting of others?  
 
  >> if __CH1__ == [TAILS]  
  >> __FQ2:__ What if I flip the coin 999 times and all 999 times it lands heads up. What do you think it will land on the 1000th flip?  
  >>__CH2:__ [HEADS] [TAILS]
  >>>if __CH2__ == [HEADS]  
  >>> __RE:__ Are you normally so easily swayed?  
  >>>if __CH2__ == [TAILS]  
  >>> __RE:__ Do you root for the underdog because you see yourself as one?

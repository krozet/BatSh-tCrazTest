# How it works
  The app will randomly select 10-15 questions from its database to ask the user. A single question might contain multiple questions attached to it, or multiple random responses to the user's answer. Each answer to every question will have a "sanity" point value associated to it. At the end, if the user's sanity points reach above a specific threshold then the user will be declared Bat Sh!t Crazy.  
    
  The questions will vary from simple questions, to serious question about life & philosophy. There will be many trick questions as well, and responses to user's answers that will give them another chance to reconsider their choice. The questions are meant to be humorous and witty, causing the user to chuckle at some questions and take a second to consider others.
